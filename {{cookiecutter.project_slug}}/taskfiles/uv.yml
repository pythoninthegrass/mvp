  lock:
    desc: "Update the project's lockfile."
    summary: |
      If the project lockfile (uv.lock) does not exist, it will be created. If a lockfile is present, its contents will be used as preferences for the resolution.

      If there are no changes to the project's dependencies, locking will have no effect unless the --upgrade flag is provided.
    cmds:
      - uv lock
    dir: "{{.ROOT_DIR}}"

  sync:
    desc: "Sync dependencies with lockfile"
    summary: |
      Syncing ensures that all project dependencies are installed and up-to-date with the lockfile.

      By default, an exact sync is performed: uv removes packages that are not declared as dependencies of the project.
    cmds:
      - uv sync --frozen
    dir: "{{.ROOT_DIR}}"

  update-deps:
    desc: "Update dependencies"
    summary: |
      Allow package upgrades, ignoring pinned versions in any existing output file. Implies --refresh
    cmds:
      - uv lock --upgrade

  export-reqs:
    desc: "Export requirements.txt"
    summary: |
      Export the project dependencies to a requirements.txt file.
    cmds:
      - uv pip freeze > {{.ROOT_DIR}}/requirements.txt
